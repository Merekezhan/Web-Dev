        <p id="history-info">The state of Switzerland took its present form with the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. Switzerland's precursors established a defensive alliance in 1291, forming a loose confederation that persisted for centuries.</p>
        <h2 class="Geo-and-clim-h2">Geography</h2>
        <p class="Geography-and-Climate">Extending across the north and south side of the Alps in west-central Europe, Switzerland encompasses diverse landscapes and climates across its 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi).</p>

        <h2 class="Geo-and-clim-h2">Climate</h2>
        <p class="Geography-and-Climate">The Swiss climate is generally temperate, but can vary greatly across localities,[75] from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the near-Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. Some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland offer cold-hardy palm trees. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall, ideal for pastures/grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see weeks-long intervals of stable conditions. At the same time, the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion during such periods, hiding the sun</p>
