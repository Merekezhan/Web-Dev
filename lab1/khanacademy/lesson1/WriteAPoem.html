    <h2>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost</h2>
    <h3>Basic information</h3>
    <p>This poem, written in 1922, is one of Robert Frost’s most famous works. It captures a moment of quiet reflection as the speaker pauses in the woods on a snowy evening. The beauty of nature, the stillness of the moment, and the speaker’s internal musings create a sense of peace and wonder.</p>
    
    <h3>The poem’s iconic lines:</h3>
    <p><em>"The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep."</em></p><p>These lines are often interpreted as a meditation on life’s obligations and the journey we all must continue, even when we crave rest. It’s a reminder to find beauty in the small moments but also to stay committed to our responsibilities.</p>
